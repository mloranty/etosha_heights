  - planet mosaics clipped to EH boundary align. which is nice for analyhses of change detection 
  - need to examine how to stack and assign doy for phenology curve fitting; perhaps scrape image date from support files
  - also will probably need day of water year, rather than julian day
  - phenofit and phoenor packages look like decent options
  - should probably get more planet data before pursuing further
